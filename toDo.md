# ToDoList
***
**SIRE**
* evolution of the code: tail evolution effects, other mechanisms (like noise)
* for other machines (=other parameters, other inputs for tracking)?
* benchmarking with non-Gaussian theoretical models, to be developed
***
**Lumi estimations and distributions**
* to estimate luminosity for unequal beams and with xing
* calculate non-gaussian lumi for nominal fills, based on measured distributions, does it give a better estimation? can we include it in the lumi model? 
* for burn-off, Gaussians are assumed, to be revised
* MD to see tails at FB, coming from IBS mainly, do they get lighter (and/or reach a limit)?
* analysis on saved distributions
* in future, ask also to acquire longitudinal distributions for all fills. Now we have only a few examples, coming mainly from MDs
***
**General for Lumi Follow up**\
* Scripts for summary pkl & plots used for Lumi follow-up. See what are the plots that are actually needed.
* Nikos scripts (and variable names) for automated tool
* Analysis scripts: emittance growth, bunch classes, intensity and losses, brightness correlations, luminosity (of a Fill, the cumalated)
**Lumi model**\
* Run updated Model for the follow-up (we used to run the old model and the model only with coupling)
* To prepare techn. note for the updated model, maybe in lumi days proceedings
