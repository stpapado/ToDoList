# ToDoList
***
**SIRE**
* evolution of the code: tail evolution effects, other mechanisms (like noise)
* for other machines (=other parameters, other inputs for tracking)?
* benchmarking with non-Gaussian theoretical models, to be developed
***
**Lumi estimations and distributions**
* to estimate luminosity for unequal beams and with xing
* calculate non-gaussian lumi for nominal fills, based on measured distributions, does it give a better estimation? can we include it in the lumi model? 
* for burn-off, Gaussians are assumed, to be revised
* MD to see tails at FB, coming from IBS mainly, do they get lighter (and/or reach a limit)?
* analysis on saved distributions, profiles to be analyzed and included in the model -> check with measured luminosity
* in future, ask also to acquire longitudinal distributions for all fills. Now we have only a few examples, coming mainly from MDs. 
* Also, longitudinal profile analysis needs to be done in python (now we are based on Michi's matlab scripts). Ask T. Argyropoulos about similar work already been done.
***
**General for Lumi Follow up**
* Scripts for summary pkl & plots used for Lumi follow-up. See what are the plots that are actually needed.
* Nikos scripts (and variable names) for automated tool
* Analysis scripts: emittance growth, bunch classes, intensity and losses, brightness correlations, luminosity (of a Fill, the cumalated)
***
**Lumi model**
* Run updated Model for the follow-up (we used to run the old model and the model only with coupling)
* To prepare techn. note for the updated model, maybe in lumi days proceedings
* Monitor the statistics, to get emittances fill by fill, give back a table per mechanism that is responsible for emittance growth -> useful for coordination
* Rogelio uses a code for lumi estimation, can we have a common tool?
* MAD-X to calculate lumi instantaneous, with all the effects considered
